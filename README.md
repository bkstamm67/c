These are example C programs I completed while a student.  C was the primary programming
language used at my university.  These programs are from an assortment of classes, but most
come from my Operating Systems class.

The socketCPP has a partner program in my CPP file, which creates a "chat" program which runs
on the university's server (called 'flip').
